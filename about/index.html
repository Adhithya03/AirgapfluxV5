      <h2>Goal</h2>

      <p>The aim of the website is to curate electrical engineering resources which explain concepts in a way that makes
        students and engineers love the subject.</p>

      <h3>Credits</h3>

      <p>As a hobby programmer, I am amazed by what I could achieve with the help of BING Chatbot (GPT-4) and ChatGPT
        for technical guidance and learning.</p>

      <p>I am very grateful to OpenAI for creating a new way of accessing knowledge like never before and to Microsoft
        for making it available at scale.</p>

      <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

      <p>I dedicate this website to some of the people who inspired me to pursue electrical engineering and to whom I am
        very grateful:</p>

      <h2> Hosting </h2>

      <p>The website is hosted on Hostinger.in for two years and the domain name is registered on godaddy.com for three
        years. The total cost so far [9-8-2023] is about $100.</p>

      <h2> Front END </h2>

      <p>The UI is based on IBM's <strong>Carbon Design System</strong> and uses React JSX with Vite as the package
        bundler.</p>

      <h2> Backend </h2>
      <p>The backend is built with PHP, Algolia for search functionality and MYSQL for database management.</p>

      <h1>For devs and nerds</h1>

      Core front end files are located responsible for what user is seeing on screen
