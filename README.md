# AirgapfluxV5
This is the source code for https://airgapflux.in, a website that provides high-quality electrical engineering resources.

# Project Technical Details

## Goal
The aim of the website is to teach electrical engineering concepts in a way that makes students and engineers love the subject.

## Hosting
The website is hosted on Hostinger.in for two years and the domain name is registered on godaddy.com for three years. The total cost so far [9-8-2023] is about $100.

## Front END
The UI is based on IBM's **Carbon Design System** and uses React JSX with Vite as the package bundler.

## Backend
The backend is built with PHP, Algolia for search functionality and MYSQL for database management.
