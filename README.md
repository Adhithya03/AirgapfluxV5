This is the source code for [Airgapflux.in](https://airgapflux.in), can be found [Here](https://github.com/Adhithya03/AirgapfluxV5)

## Goal
The aim of the website is to curate electrical engineering resources which explain concepts in a way that makes students and engineers love the subject.



### Credits

As a hobby programmer, I am amazed by what I could achieve with the help of BING Chatbot (GPT-4) and ChatGPT for technical guidance and learning.

I am very grateful to OpenAI for creating a new way of accessing knowledge like never before and to Microsoft for making it available at scale.

## Acknowledgements

I dedicate this website to some of the people who inspired me to pursue electrical engineering and to whom I am very grateful:

- Prof. **Alexandra von Meier**, author of "A Conceptual Introduction to Power Systems" and professor at UC Berkeley.

# Project Technical Details

## How website search works?

![searchWorking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adhithya03/AirgapfluxV5//main/about/searchWorking.jpg)

## Hosting
The website is hosted on Hostinger.in for two years and the domain name is registered on godaddy.com for three years. The total cost so far [9-8-2023] is about $100.

## Front END
The UI is based on IBM's **Carbon Design System** and uses React JSX with Vite as the package bundler.

## Backend
The backend is built with PHP, Algolia for search functionality and MYSQL for database management.
